              <li><b>During the beta period, an invite code is required to create an account. Someone you know must send you one.</b></li>
              <li><b>This site doesn't yet work in Safari or Internet Explorer; Google Chrome is recommended.</b></li>
              <li><b>There is no guarantee that recordings you create or songs you upload will survive past the beta period, although an attempt will be made to preserve them.</b></li>
              <li><b>Use of the site during the beta period will be free.  Once the beta period ends, existing users may need to begin to pay for the site to create new recordings.  The beta period is expected to last until at least June 1, 2019.</b></li>

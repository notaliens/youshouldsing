  - How do we deal with someone forgetting which service he used to
    login with?  How do we deal with it if a user wants to log in
    to the same yss account using two different oauth providers?

  - Allow "real" logout (currently when you logout and log back in, it logs
    you in as the last account you used with that provder).

  - Impersonation.

  - Disqus SSO.

  - Show username/photo in navbar when logged in.

  - Require user to validate email address.

- Song import:

  - Handle conflict errors.

- Song

  - Add to singlist
  - Song timings editor (post-speech)
  - Postprocess retimings (cope with API call error unexpected state when
    file is deleted too)
  - Song timing word endings don't seem to be right... see whiter shade.
  - Crowdsource lyric retimings... allow uploader to accept lyric timing
    suggestions.
  - Recognize dupe song metadata and group together on other recordings page.

- Homepage:

  Featured recordings should take into account number of likes vs.  number of
  views, whether it's "members only", and perhaps number of comments.

  We need to index the number of times a song has been recorded.  This is
  a rough measure of its popularity.

  Public recordings tend to get about 20 hits per year for a not-currently-hot
  song.  Private recordings maybe 5-10.

  song_popularity = num_recordings on scale of 0 to 100 over site lifetime

  use song popularity as a handicap

- View recording:

  - Dropdown for who liked instead of inline table
  - Dropdown for other recordings instead of inline table.
  - "Likes disabled" instead of "0 performers have liked this recording"
    when like permission is not available.
  - Remix should be just another tab on view-recording.
  - "Other recordings you might like if you like this one"

  - Private/public/authenticated/group viewers (workflow?)
  - Allow/disallow likes
  - Allow/disallow comments
  - Description

- Remix recording

  - no video
  - adjust latency
  - Relative mic volume doesnt work

- Record:

  - Safari (mobile or desktop) doesn't support MediaRecorder.
    https://www.gmass.co/blog/record-audio-mobile-web-page-ios-android/
  - Mic volume slider has no effect.
  - Scrub on playonly
  - Unhelpful errors when camera is already used (e.g. by OBS).
  - Handle conflict errors in postprocessing.
  - Latency handling.
  - Maybe instead of building some system to arbitrarily time-align
    source audio and mic audio after latency, just let people clap
    a pattern.  https://medium.com/@almeidneto/sound-pattern-recognition-with-python-9aff69edce5d
  - Do less work in postprocessing to produce a mix; currently we
    transcode all over the place. Probably really should mix on browser,
    not on server.
  - Remove recorded song from singlist.
  - Recordings should probably be inside the performer folder so we
    can set e.g. 'yss.edit' permission only on the performer instead
    of on each recording she creates.
  - Description
  - Relative music volume doesn't work.

- Search:

  - Index lyrics into song text index.

  - Provide an "X" which removes the current filter.
  
- Allow uploads of songs (yikes)

- Tests

- JS:

  - Upgrade bootstrap and jquery (or ditch and go with the new hotness,
    whatever those are).  NB: newest bootstrap uses SASS instead of LESS,
    so would need to switch over to that.  Currently using latest
    bootstrap that used LESS (3.4.0).

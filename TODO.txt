- Login:

  - Facebook login
  - How do we deal with someone forgetting which service he used to
    login with?  How do we deal with it if a user wants to log in
    to the same yss account using two different oauth providers?
  - Impersonation.
  - Require user to validate email address.
  - Know what happens when we need to change consumer secret or details about
    app in developer settings.
  - Non-oauth signups.
  - Keep around original google/twitter login name so we can manually
    find their account and associate with another oauth identity if user loses
    access to twitter/google.

- Artist

  - Create artist page that shows all songs by an artist***

- Song import:

  - Handle conflict errors.

- Song

  - Listen to song.***
  - Add to singlist
  - Song timings editor (post-speech)
  - Postprocess retimings (cope with API call error unexpected state when
    file is deleted too)
  - Song timing word endings don't seem to be right... see whiter shade.
  - Crowdsource lyric retimings... allow uploader to accept lyric timing
    suggestions.
  - Recognize dupe song metadata and group together on other recordings page.
  - Recordings of this song as tab***
  - Performers who like this song as tab***
  - Allow uploads (yikes)***
  - Allow cancel of retime.***
  - Workflow for accepting retime as canonical.***

Songs

  - Filter by genre

- Homepage:

  - Featured recordings should take into account number of likes vs.  number of
    views, whether it's "members only", and perhaps number of comments.
  - We need to index the number of times a song has been recorded.  This is
    a rough measure of its popularity.
  - Public recordings tend to get about 20 hits per year for a not-currently-hot
    song.  Private recordings maybe 5-10.
  - song_popularity = num_recordings on scale of 0 to 100 over site lifetime
  - use song popularity as a handicap
  - if the song is part of a contest, that needs to be factored in too

Profile Recordings

  - Tint background color of table row of private and authenticated-only
    recordings different colors.

- Profile:

  - Delete/edit recordings***
  - Change password***
  - Forgot password***
  - Singlist
  - Description***
  - Delete account
  - Deleting a profile should delete its associated user (otherwise, problems
    when someone relogs in using that oauth account)***
  - Accept gravatar image as initial photo from oauth
  - Member since***
  - # of public songs recorded on header of profile views***
  - Show which authorizer (google/twitter/etc) in profile somehow.
  - Maybe medium sized prescaled photo for profile header.
  - Profile header photo when clicked should show large sized photo in
    overlay.***
  - All uses of photos in img tags should be surrounded by fixed size div
    box.***
  - Don't use "title" as realname, too easy to mistakenly expose.
  - Do better when people log in from Google getting profile create
    fields right
  - Show new icon without a shift reload when editing profile and icon
    changes.

- View recording:

  - Dropdown for who liked instead of inline table***
  - Dropdown for other recordings instead of inline table.***
  - "Likes disabled" instead of "0 performers have liked this recording"
    when like permission is not available.
  - "Other recordings you might like if you like this one"
  - Disqus SSO.***

- Edit recording:

  - Allow/disallow likes***
  - Allow/disallow comments***
  - Delete this recording
  - Description should allow links and embedded videos
  - When acl is empty, dont set it, when setting visibility, delete it instead.

- Remix recording

  - Show logo or something on vids without camera or who are remixed to not
    allow.***

- Record:

  - Safari (mobile or desktop) doesn't support MediaRecorder.
    https://www.gmass.co/blog/record-audio-mobile-web-page-ios-android/
  - Mic volume slider has no effect.***
  - Scrub on playonly***
  - Unhelpful errors when camera is already used (e.g. by OBS).
  - Handle conflict errors in postprocessing.
  - Maybe instead of building some system to arbitrarily time-align
    source audio and mic audio after latency, just let people clap
    a pattern.  https://medium.com/@almeidneto/sound-pattern-recognition-with-python-9aff69edce5d
  - Do less work in postprocessing to produce a mix; currently we
    transcode all over the place.
  - Mix in browser, not on server.
  - Remove recorded song from singlist.
  - Recordings should probably be inside the performer folder so we
    can set e.g. 'yss.edit' permission only on the performer instead
    of on each recording she creates.
  - Duet***
  - Set guessed latency on initial record
  - Karaoke display seems random which line is chosen next to display
    upcoming lyrics.
  - Negative mic latency.***
  - It's too easy to hit cancel on a new recording and lose it.
  - Allow 16x9

- Search:

  - Index lyrics into song text index.
  
- JS:

  - Upgrade bootstrap and jquery (or ditch and go with the new hotness,
    whatever those are).  NB: newest bootstrap uses SASS instead of LESS,
    so would need to switch over to that.  Currently using latest
    bootstrap that used LESS (3.4.0).

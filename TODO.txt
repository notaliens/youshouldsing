Songs

  - Filter by genre
  - Filter by year

- Homepage:

  - Featured recordings should take into account number of likes vs.  number of
    views, whether it's "members only", and perhaps number of comments.
  - We need to index the number of times a song has been recorded.  This is
    a rough measure of its popularity.
  - Public recordings tend to get about 20 hits per year for a not-currently-hot
    song.  Private recordings maybe 5-10.
  - song_popularity = num_recordings on scale of 0 to 100 over site lifetime
  - use song popularity as a handicap
  - if the song is part of a contest, that needs to be factored in too

- Profile:

  - Singlist
  - Description requires nl2br or full HTML editing.

  - Accept gravatar image as initial photo from oauth
  - Member since
  - Show which authorizer (google/twitter/etc) in profile somehow.
  - Maybe medium sized prescaled photo for profile header.
  - Profile header photo when clicked should show large sized photo in
    overlay.
  - All uses of photos in img tags should be surrounded by fixed size div
    box.
  - Don't use "title" as realname, too easy to mistakenly expose.
  - Do better when people log in from Google getting profile create
    fields right***
  - Show new icon without a shift reload when editing profile and icon
    changes.
  - Not divulging a tab should still allow the performer to see the tab.***
  - Editing requires supplying a photo even if one exists (possibly after
    tempfiles are cleaned up, not always).

    (detect and warn).
  - Mic volume slider has no effect.
  - Unhelpful errors when camera is already used (e.g. by OBS).
  - Handle conflict errors in postprocessing.
  - Maybe instead of building some system to arbitrarily time-align
    source audio and mic audio after latency, just let people clap
    a pattern.  https://medium.com/@almeidneto/sound-pattern-recognition-with-python-9aff69edce5d
  - Mix in browser, not on server.
  - Remove recorded song from singlist.
  - Duet

- JS:

  - Upgrade bootstrap and jquery (or ditch and go with the new hotness,
    whatever those are).  NB: newest bootstrap uses SASS instead of LESS,
    so would need to switch over to that.  Currently using latest
    bootstrap that used LESS (3.4.0).

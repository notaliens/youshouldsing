- General

  - csrf

  - configure auditing

  - should probably use browser timezone instead of user-specified SDI timezone
  
- Login:

  - Google login

  - Facebook login

  - Provide an interstitial page before a performer is created that
    allows a user to choose his username, change his photo, etc.

  - How do we deal with someone forgetting which service he used to
    login with?  How do we deal with it if a user wants to log in
    to the same yss account using two different oauth providers?

  - Allow "real" logout (currently when you logout and log back in, it logs
    you in as the last account you used with that provder).

  - Impersonation.

  - Disqus SSO.

- Song import:

  - Handle conflict errors.

- Homepage:

  Featured recordings should take into account number of likes vs.  number of
  views, whether it's "members only", and perhaps number of comments.

- Profile:

  - Divulge age
  - Divulge sex
  - Divulge song likes
  - Divulge recording likes
  - Divulge performer likes
  - Divulge real name
  - Delete/edit recordings
  - Timezone
  - Flash message on edit

- View recording:

  - Dropdown for who liked instead of inline table
  - Dropdown for other recordings instead of inline table.
  - "Likes disabled" instead of "0 performers have liked this recording"
    when like permission is not available.

- Edit recording:

  - Private/public/authenticated viewers (workflow?)
  - Allow/disallow likes
  - Allow/disallow comments
  - Remix (e.g. no video, adjust latency)

- Record:

  - Safari (mobile or desktop) doesn't support MediaRecorder.

  - Mic volume slider has no effect.
  - Scrub on playonly
  - Unhelpful errors when camera is already used (e.g. by OBS).
  - Handle conflict errors in postprocessing.
  - Latency handling.
  - Maybe instead of building some system to arbitrarily time-align
    source audio and mic audio after latency, just let people clap
    a pattern.
  - Do less work in postprocessing to produce a mix; currently we
    transcode all over the place.
  - Probably should mix on browser, not on server.

- Search:

  - Index lyrics into song text index

  - Provide an "X" which removes the current filter.
  
- Allow uploads of songs (yikes)

- Tests

- JS:

  - Upgrade bootstrap and jquery (or ditch and go with the new hotness,
    whatever those are).  NB: newest bootstrap uses SASS instead of LESS,
    so would need to switch over to that.  Currently using latest
    bootstrap that used LESS (3.4.0).
